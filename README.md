# FA Popup

FA Popup is an addon to the FA object for forumotion forums. The purpose is to create a quick popup module that can be used on the forum for quickly viewing previews, searches, notifications, and more..

To install it on your forum, you should first install the *fa_popup* script in all the pages. This script contains the main API for openning and creating popups. The rest are plugins which can also be installed in all pages. A more indepth tutorial will be created soon.

For now, here are some previews of what this plugin is capable of.
